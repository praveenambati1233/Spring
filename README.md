Spring AOP

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) complements Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by providing another way of thinking about program structure. 

The key unit of modularity in OOP is the **class**, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity is the **aspect**.

Aspects enable the modularization of crosscutting concerns such as transaction management, security, logging, or  custom aspects, complementing their use of OOP with AOP.
